usage: lognestmonster [OPTION]... <QUEUE>

The lognestmonster library allows you to generate log files with an organized
nesting format. Use this lognestmonster command to parse files generated by
the lognestmonster library.

By default, inputting a queue file, a folder with queue files, or switching
stdin (passing "-" for QUEUE) will display an interactive textual interface
where keyboard events are used to sift through log statements. Using the
status switch (-s, --status), you can do a quick read of the instream and only
display metadata, such as the number of statements or events, rather than a
textual user interface. If the follow switch is used (-f, --follow), the
parser will keep the instreams open and generate live logtrees. Switching
stdin ("-") automatically switches follow. See other switches and options for
the ability to narrow down log results. Log-unrelated commands (help, version,
or no args) do not require a QUEUE variable.

Unless manually switched, the verbosity levels `verbose` (-v) and
`veryverbose` (-vv) are not displayed in the interactive textual interface.

-h, -?, --help            Displays program description and a list of valid
                          options and other arguments
--version                 Displays program information about copyright and the
                          version
-s, --status              Reads the directory and outputs file and log
                          metadata for each log tree
-e, --errors              Omits all statements besides errors. Stackable with
                          other verbosity level commands
-w, --warnings            Omits all statements besides warnings. Stackable
                          with other verbosity level commands
-i, --info                Omits all statements besides those with verbosity
                          type 'info'. Stackable with other verbosity level
                          commands
-d, --debug               Omits all statements besides those with verbosity
                          type 'debug'. Stackable with other verbosity level
                          commands
-v, --verbose             Omits all statements besides those with verbosty
                          type 'verbose'. Stackable with other verbosity level
                          commands
-vv, --veryverbose        Omits all statements besides those with verbosity
                          type 'veryverbose'. Stackable with other verbosity
                          level commands
--after                   Limits log results to after a certain timestamp. A
                          millisecond UNIX timestamp must be provided
--before                  Limits log results to before a certain timestamp. A
                          millisecond UNIX timestamp must be provided.
-t, --tag                 Limits log results to a tag. A string of the
                          tag/invoker must be provided
-c                        Limits log results to a numbered statement
-q                        Limits log results to a numbered event and its
                          children
-f, --follow              Provides a live view of the log tree stream, similar
                          to the 'tail -f' command
